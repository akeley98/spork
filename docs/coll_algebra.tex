\myTitle{Exo GPU (Spork) Collective Algebra}

Thoughts on how to formally model subdividing groups of threads, thread indexing, and thread convergence (e.g. for barriers or warp/warpgroup tensor core MMA).

\filbreak
\mainKey{Collective Unit:} A ``unit of measurement'' for threads arranged in a certain shape.
For example ``32 consecutive threads'' is a collective unit.
This would be a warp if aligned, but in Spork, alignment is not generally a property of a collective unit.
We only check alignment as an additional requirement when matching collective units for lowering \lighttt{instr} and barriers.

\filbreak
Nevertheless, we use familiar terms like ``warp'' for user-facing code; this is only an abuse-of-notation in the rare case that the user chooses to misalign threads.

\filbreak
Collective units need not be contiguous.
For example, a quadpair -- two groups of four threads each, offset by 16 from each other -- is a collective unit, and is distinct in shape from 8 contiguous threads.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Thread Collective:} A grouping of threads dynamically created at runtime.
The shape of the group is described by a collective unit.
For example, threads 0-31, threads 32-63, threads 64-95 ... are all distinct thread collectives that share the collective unit ``warp''.
Threads [0, 3] $\cup$ [16, 19], threads [4, 7] $\cup$ [20, 23], etc. are distinct thread collectives with collective unit ``quadpair''.

\filbreak
A parallel-for loop causes a distinct thread collective to be assigned to execute each iteration.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Top-level Collective:} A CUDA cluster, including the degenerate case of a single CTA if \lighttt{clusterDim = 1} (as is usually the case).
This terminology can generalize to other APIs.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Collective Tiling:} A collective tiling either describes the top-level collective, or describes how the thread collectives for executing statements within a parallel for loop or specialization statement are generated.
Collective tilings are arranged in a parent-child relationship, with each parallel for loop creating a new child that suballocates threads from the parent, and with the top-level parent being the top-level collective.

\filbreak
The primary purpose of this document is to build up to a full description of the collective tiling, and the principles (but not necessarily the imperative details) of how it's constructed.
\textbf{Throughout the Exo codebase -- for both internal and user-facing code -- } we will use ``\blacktt{coll}'' consistently as an abbreviation for ``collective''.
The word ``collective'' is too long, and if we don't create an official abbreviation, the temptation too create incompatible, ad-hoc abbreviations is just too high.

\filbreak
\myTitle{Domain}

The first thing we'll do is arrange the threads of the top-level collective into an N-dimensional ``domain grid''.
The \myKeyA{full domain} describes the size along each dimension of this grid.
For a CUDA cluster, this is (\lighttt{clusterDim}, \lighttt{blockDim}).
This could generalize to non-CUDA APIs, but there's a built-in assumption that the left-most dimension is the ``most significant''.

A domain must consist only of positive integers, and \textit{should} contain only values at least 2.
However, 1 values may result when substituting parameters (as would occur in the common case that \lighttt{clusterDim = 1}).
We can fix this later, as part of domain completion.

\filbreak
The thread count of a domain is the product of its coordinates.
A \myKeyA{partial domain} is a domain whose total thread count is lower than that of the top-level collective.
For example, \lighttt{(blockDim,)} is a partial domain if \lighttt{clusterDim != 1}.

\filbreak
Jumping ahead somewhat, physical threads are arranged in the domain grid by the top-level collective tiling's \myKeyA{intra-box expressions}.
For a CUDA cluster, these expressions are (\lighttt{blockIdx.x \% clusterDim}, \lighttt{threadIdx.x}).

\filbreak
\mainSub{Domain Completion}

Collective units and collective tilings are described in terms of their domain.
Often, their domains are not the same.
We reconcile this with domain completion, translating both to a common domain.
Domain completion consists of (up to) 3 steps in order.

\filbreak
Here, we only describe the steps for modifying the domain.
Whenever we modify the $n^{th}$ coordinate of a domain, we modify in parallel the $n^{th}$ coordinate of each attribute of a collective unit or collective tiling.
We'll describe this later.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Partial Prepend:} If the source domain is partial, we prepend $\frac{t}{s}$, where $t$ is the thread count of the full domain and $s$ is the thread count of the partial domain.
If this is not an integer, this step fails.

Side note, this is the main place where the left-most $\equiv$ ``most significant'' assumption is made.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Coordinate Removal:} Each domain coordinate that's 1 is removed.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Coordinate Splitting:} Domain coordinate values $c$ may be split into two consecutive coordinates $(\frac{c}{f}, f)$, where $f$ is the \myKeyA{splitting factor}.

\filbreak
\mainSub{Domain Completion Example}

Let's say we have two domains

\textbf{A:} (1, 64, 16)\\
\textbf{B:} (16, 128)

with \textbf{A} being a \myKeyA{partial domain} ($s = 1024$ threads) and \textbf{B} being a \myKeyA{full domain} ($t = 2048$ threads).
This is not very realistic for the CUDA use case; it's just for illustration.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Partial Prepend:} Since \textbf{A} is a partial domain, we prepend $2 = \frac{t}{s}$.

$\downarrow$ {\color{grayttColor} (1, 64, 16)} \\
\textbf{A:} (\blueBox{2}, 1, 64, 16)

$\downarrow$ {\color{grayttColor} (16, 128)} \\
\textbf{B:} (16, 128)

\filbreak
\mainKey{Coordinate Removal:} Remove the redundant 1 in \textbf{A}.

$\downarrow$ {\color{grayttColor} (2, \redBox{1}, 64, 16)} \\
\textbf{A:} (2, 64, 16)

$\downarrow$ {\color{grayttColor} (16, 128)} \\
\textbf{B:} (16, 128)

\filbreak
\mainKey{Coordinate Splitting:} Multiple splits are required to reconcile \textbf{A} and \textbf{B}.

$\downarrow$ {\color{grayttColor} (2, \violetBox{64}, 16)} \\
\textbf{A:} (2, \violetBox{8, 8}, 16) \\
Splitting factor: \violetBox{8}

$\downarrow$ {\color{grayttColor} (\blueBox{16}, \greenBox{128})} \\
\textbf{B:} (\blueBox{2, 8}, \greenBox{8, 16}) \\
Splitting factors: \blueBox{8}, \greenBox{16}

\filbreak
\myTitle{Collective Unit}

A collective unit consists of a \myKeyA{domain} and \myKeyA{box} size.
The box is \lighttt{Optional[int]}-valued and has the same dimension as the domain.
If the box contains a None coordinate, it's said to be \myKeyA{agnostic} on that dimension, and can't match any real thread collective.

\filbreak
Otherwise, given a certain domain, the collective unit for a thread collective is defined by the said domain and the shape of the filled axis-aligned box the threads form when arranged in the domain grid.\footnote{If the threads don't form a filled box, no collective unit with the given domain can match the thread collective.}
For example, with the domain being (\lighttt{clusterDim}, \lighttt{blockDim}), the box for a single warp is (1, 32), while the box for ``one warp chosen from each CTA in the cluster'' is (\lighttt{clusterDim}, 32) \textbf{(figure \ref{fig:units})}.

\filbreak
Due to domain completion, the ``warp'' collective unit can be described with domain=(\lighttt{blockDim},), box=(32,).
This is (almost) equivalent to the warp given in the example.

\mainSub{Collective Unit Domain Completion}

When doing domain completion, the corresponding steps for the box attribute are:

\filbreak
\mainKey{Partial Prepend:} If we are matching collective units (e.g. to enforce an \lighttt{instr}'s requirements), prepend 1.
Otherwise, prepend None.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Coordinate Removal:} All removed coordinate values must be 1.

\filbreak
\mainKey{Coordinate Splitting:} A None value is split into (None, None).
An integer value $c$ splits into $(1, c)$ if $c < f$; otherwise, it splits into $(\frac{c}{f}, f)$.
If the results are not integers, the domain completion fails.

\filbreak
If we were accepting unaligned thread collectives, collective unit domain completion (as an unintended side-effect) makes the collective unit stricter, as some unaligned thread collectives will no longer form valid boxes in the new domain.
Domain completion won't affect matching of aligned thread collectives.
