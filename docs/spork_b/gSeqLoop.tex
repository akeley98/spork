\magicSubsection{Sequential (\texttt{seq}) Loop}{sec:gSeqLoop}

Loop with loop mode \lighttt{Seq} (def~\ref{sec:gLoopMode}).
Each thread of the thread collective (def~\ref{sec:gThreadCollective}) executes each iteration of the loop sequentially.
There is no convergence or coherence guaranteed between threads cooperating to execute the loop.
