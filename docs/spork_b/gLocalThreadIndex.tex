\magicSubsection{Local Thread Index}{sec:gLocalThreadIndex}

0-based integer index uniquely identifying a thread within a cluster.
The threads are indexed lexicographically by (CTA index, thread index in CTA).
The closed-form equation is \lighttt{cluster\_ctarank * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x}

Note, not to be confused with linear thread IDs (tid) in camspork, which also encodes the task index (Section~\ref{sec:SyncSemanticsThreadMapping}).
