\magicSubsection{Shard}{sec:gShard}

Suppose there are $R$-many distributed dimensions (def~\ref{sec:gDistributedDimension}) for a certain tensor $x$ (or barrier $z$, skipped for brevity).
A set of array elements of $x$ are co-located in the same shard if their index tuples all match in the first $R$ dimensions.
