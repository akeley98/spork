\magicSubsection{Sync-Exempt}{sec:gSyncExempt}

Certain memory types are sync-exempt, as defined by their Python\\
\lighttt{AllocableMemWin.sync\_exempt()} function.
All reads and writes to array elements stored in sync-exempt memory type are no-ops in the abstract machine (Section~\ref{sec:SyncSemantics}), i.e., no hazards will ever be diagnosed for variables stored in sync-exempt memory.
