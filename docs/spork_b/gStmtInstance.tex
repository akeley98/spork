\magicSubsection{Statement Instance}{sec:gStmtInstance}

A \emph{statement} is a syntactic construct, while a \emph{statement instance} is a single interpretation/``execution'' of a statement. For example, ``\lighttt{for i in seq(0, 10): $s_1$; $s_2$}'' is a loop containing two statements: $s_1$ and $s_2$, and when the loop is executed, 20 statement instances are created (10 instances of $s_1$ and 10 instances of $s_2$).
