\magicSubsection{Cluster}{sec:gCluster}
Group of \lighttt{clusterDim}-many CTAs (def~\ref{sec:gCta}) that execute concurrently on the same GPC, and can synchronize with cluster sync, or using mbarriers.
When \lighttt{clusterDim = 1} (which is the case by default for Exo-GPU), then CTA and cluster are synonymous.
The PTX variable \lighttt{cluster\_ctarank} is the 0-based index of the CTA in the cluster.
