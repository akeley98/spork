\magicSubsection{Aligned Form (Collective Type)}{sec:gAlignedForm}

A collective type $\delta$ is in aligned form when all box coordinates $\delta.B_i$ satisfy $\delta.B_i \in \{\top, 1, \delta.D_i\}$.
If no box coordinate is $\top$, then if two thread collectives are both instances of $\delta$, those two thread collectives are either identical or disjoint.
