\magicSubsection{Instruction Timeline}{sec:gInstrTL}

Attribute of Exo-GPU instructions (Section~\ref{sec:InstrTL}).
Together with the memory type accessed, this indirectly controls the qualitative timelines (def~\ref{sec:gQualTL}) associated with the executed instruction's memory accesses (Section~\ref{sec:VisRecordCreation}).
The instruction timeline exists only to help externalize instruction definitions; it is not directly involved in defining abstract machine semantics.
