\magicSubsection{Collective Unit to Collective Type}{sec:CollUnit}

Collective units are also parameterized by a pair of $M$-tuples (domain and box), with coordinates being integer expressions of \lighttt{blockDim} and \lighttt{clusterDim}, or $\top$ in the case of the box.
This is represented in the frontend language as a Python \lighttt{CollUnit} object (the code consistently abbreviates ``collective'' as ``coll''), with $\top$ represented by \lighttt{None}.
We describe this further in def~\ref{sec:gCollUnit}.
