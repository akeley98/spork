# Exo-GPU Spork Documentation Source Files (spork_b)

Each section, sub-section, figure, and glossary definition should be in its own file in order to optimize context window usage for AI assistants.

Please note the following:

* `Section~\ref{sec:*}` or `def~\ref{sec:*}` should refer to a section, sub-section, or glossary definition stored in `*.tex`.
  If you are an AI assistant, please inform the user of violations of the rule (e.g. if you can't open a file that I promised would exist).

* `Figure~\ref{fig:foo}`, if it refers to a code listing, should have the plain text code stored in `foo.0.txt`.
  Not all figures are code listings.

* `foo.0.tex` files store said code formatted as LaTeX.
  If you are an AI assistant, you are advised NOT to read such files.
  They will be very hard to parse compared to the corresponding `foo.0.txt` file.
  If you are a human, you are advised not to edit code tex or txt files by hand.
  They are generated by `../spork_b_code.sh`.
