\magicSubsection{$\mathbb{S}$ (mathbb-S)}{sec:gMathbbS}

Used in the PLDI submission to mean the set of all visibility functions, which corresponds to visibility sets (def~\ref{sec:gVisSet}) in Exo-GPU as it is currently formulated.
Note ``visibility function'' is not a term used in the PLDI submission; this is retroactive terminology for this deprecated concept.
